# isic-2024

The competition was hosted on Kaggle and the task was to detect malignant skin lesions.

By analyzing the [1st solution](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge/discussion/533196), I found that the parameters of CatBoost can be retuned to improve the score (from 0.17264 to 0.17284). 
 - Run isic-2024-catboost (1).ipynb to retune the paramaters of catboost.
 - Substitute the modified parameters into the 1st solution [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wanyizhouzzz/first-place-submission-1) .
